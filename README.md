<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/PatrickNv23/Button-Component/blob/main/src/assets/screenshoot_buttoncomponent.png)

- Where can I see your demo?
  This frontend challenge was uploaded to the Netlify domains, because it is a very powerful service to upload your React projects to the internet.
- What was your experience?
  My experience at the end of this challenge has been satisfactory, because it made me review concepts that I hadn't touched in a long time and it's very entertaining to have to try to enter different types of buttons using the necessary properties.
- What have you learned/improved?
  I had to brush up on the concepts of component conditional rendering, adding different properties to each button and also learned new concepts about Material UI for CSS styles.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/ohgVTyJCbm5OZyTB2gNY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

The most important feature that this frontend challenge contains is rendering buttons with different properties to apply their CSS styles. On the other hand, it is possible to review the basic concepts of React, to create button components with different box styles, sizes, colors, icons, states, etc.
